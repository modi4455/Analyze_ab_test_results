# Investigate_the_Movie_Database
## Aim of the Project
This project was part of my Data Analyst Nano Degree @ Udacity. This project aims to assure that I have mastered the skills needed to investigate relatively large databases and drive plausible conclusions.

Language used: Python3
## Introduction
This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). This project is aiming at investigating this data set to define factors that influence user ratings and revenue. Data was downloaded fromhttps://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv.

The project demonstrates vital data analytics skills such as wrangling, EDA and data plotting. The packages utilized in this project are pandas, numpy and matplotlib.

## Contribution
As this is a learning experience for me, I do expect that there might be enhancement and simplification to my code. Please feel free to share with me your insights. It will be extremely appreciated.
